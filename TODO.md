# Can be done now
Be able to bulk pause/resume (to reduce costs if we spin up X machines the day before a workshop and pause them during night for >1day workshops)
Be able to specify a custom seed/dump/backup in args --seed to (as right now it is fixed neo4j in /dumps folder)

# For later
(When multi DB and seeding in cypher available on Aura) Load through cypher instead of spinning a docker container for neo4j-admin upload
